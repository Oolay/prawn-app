# prawn-app

A nutrient model for a pond-based prawn farm built in Python. The nutrient model first models the changes in nutrient concentrations in a single pond (solved using differential equations in Pythonâ€™s SciPy library). This pond model was then extrapolated over a whole farm and its bioremediation area over an annual production cycle.
